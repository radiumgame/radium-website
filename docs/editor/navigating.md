# Navigating the Editor
Navigating the editor can be tricky, but it's not too bad. This will go through where you can find everything you will probably need. If there is anything specific, there is always documentation on each editor window to guide you.

# Menu Bar
The menu bar is the top bar of the editor. It contains features with project management, preferences, and hidden windows. The file tab is useful for project management. You can open scenes, save scenes, and even open your project in <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>. The edit tab is used for your preferences. Change how your editor looks with themes. The Run tab is used for playing or stopping your scene. The Window tab is used for hidden windows. Hidden windows are windows that can be opened and closed.  

# Permanent Windows
Permanent windows are the windows that are always open and visible. You cannot close them and are not available in the menu bar. These windows are necessities when developing, which is why they are always open.

# Hidden Windows
Hidden windows are windows that can be opened and closed. You can open them from the menu bar under the menu tab labeled Editor Windows. These windows are catered for specfic situations. These windows are not always open, but they are always available.
